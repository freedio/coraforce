  symbol Fixed                        ( map address is fixed: MAP_FIXED )
  symbol Anonymous                    ( anonymous area, not backed by a file: MAP_ANONYMOUS )
  symbol 32bit                        ( maps the area into the first 2GB of the memory address space: MAP_32BIT )
  1 skip
  symbol GrowsDown                    ( memory area is a stack: MAP_GROWSDOWN )
  4 skip
  symbol Locked                       ( locks the memory area ... dangerous: MAP_LOCKED )
  symbol NoSwap                       ( do not reserve swap space for this area: MAP_NORESERVE )
